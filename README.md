# Illness Team Project – CS2
## Description
### What?
A user-friendly program that allows concerned parents to input their child's symptoms and outputs the possible illnesses commonly associated with the listed symptoms.  It is not a substitute for proper medical examinations but rather helps the parents examine the next steps in helping their child recover. 
### Why?
Googling symptoms can be frightening and extremely inaccurate. The internet is very unreliable when it comes to medical matters so having a firm and easy to use application with strong research to back it up will be a more accurate alternative to Dr. Google. 
### How?
The user can list symptoms in a search bar (there will be a list of symptoms available for viewing on the application) that will run through the program.  After the user clicks the search button the illnesses that match the symptoms the most will be printed first, and any illnesses that have no correlation won't be printed.  The illnesses will be rated between 0 and 5 to show how strongly they relate to the given symptoms. Next to the given rating will be a brief description of the illness and the option to print a PDF so that the parents can provide the doctors (if necessary) with the most likely illness and why.
